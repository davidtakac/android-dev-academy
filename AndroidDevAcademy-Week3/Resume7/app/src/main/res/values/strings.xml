    <string name="text_bio">
        I\'m a 21 year old computer engineering student from Croatia.\n
        I grew up in Osijek, Croatia. Ever since I was a kid, I had an interest
        in computers and tech in general. Two years ago, I enrolled in the Faculty
        of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek.\n
        Since then, I realized I wanted to devote my time to Android Development and well, here we are.

    <string name="text_work">
        The first \"job\" I worked at was provided to me by the Erasmus+ student mobility programme.
        We worked at a warehouse in Ireland and although it wasn\'t exactly a computer science related job, it was
        still a valuable experience because I learned teamwork and it helped with my English.\n\n
        Since then, I worked via the Student Union at my college on various side-jobs. No programming related work
        until now, but I\'m hoping this academy will change that.
